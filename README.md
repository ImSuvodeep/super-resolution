Super-Resolution using ESRGAN
This Python script utilizes the ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) model to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images. The ESRGAN model is a deep learning-based approach that aims to generate high-quality images with improved details.


Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. The required libraries include:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (numpy)
PyTorch (torch)
Google Colab patches (google.colab.patches)
ESRGAN repository (https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN)



Usage
Run the script in a Google Colab environment.
Adjust the path to the low-resolution images directory and image names as needed.
View the enhanced high-resolution images generated by the ESRGAN model.
Feel free to experiment with different images and settings to observe the super-resolution capabilities of ESRGAN.
